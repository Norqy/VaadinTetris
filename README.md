Vaadin Tetris
=============

This is the (cleaned up) source code for a Vaadin based Tetris game. It was originally presented during my talk "Vaadin and HTML5" in JavaDay Riga, November 2011.

This implementation uses Vaadin 6.7.2 together with CanvasWidget for rendering and DontPush OzoneLayer for websocket based communication. The used add-ons are still experimental 
implementations and may not work with all server-browser combinations. 

The Tetris game engine tries to follow the guidelines given at  http://http://tetris.wikia.com/
